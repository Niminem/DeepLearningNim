Doing some Deep Learning w/ Nim and Arraymancer

## Example 1 - DQN (Deep Q Network)
AI agent aims to keep shower temperature at 37-39 degrees cel. The shower length is 60 seconds (timesteps). Shower length is decremented each time step, with small random noise applied to simulate temperature fluctuations. AI agent is trained for 3,000 episodes.
